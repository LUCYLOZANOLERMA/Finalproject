  <h2>About Me</h2>
  
  <section class="center"> <h3>The journey of focusing on one healthy habit at a time.  I am a very blessed mother of two girls and a wife.  My focus is building on habit of health and getting a better perspective of spending quality time with my family.  I have had to work on my mindset and creating a better balance of work and family life.  I love spending time with my family and learning from my children's perspectives.  I like to be open to learn new things and be an example to my children that you can always learn new things, the power of the mind is an amazing gift.  I am working on my health coaching business, that has really helped me in my health journey as well as helping others create the health they are seeking.  </h3>
    <h3>Thank you Lily for finding this amazing coding class and teaching me a new language!</h3>
